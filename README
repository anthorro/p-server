p-server is a custom TCP server, with modules for different protocols. 
it is designed to provide a high speed, secure, useful platform for social gaming applications. 
HTTP is built now, and supports a subset of HTTP 1.1
without using any of the built in ruby net/http (cgi) libs. 
p-server uses a producer-consumer concurrency model, 
and has efficient (i.e. reused) connections to memcached and mysql 
implemented as a module called 'persist'. 
p-server includes cron functionality, 
has a logging system that logs to text files and a database, 
and has a user data management system with strong security. 
p-server connections are stateless, and one user session can 
be distributed across many nodes. The user auth system returns cookies to the 
browser which must be included in any further user HTTP requests. 

#extra note for Mogreet:
I grant a permanent, nonexclusive, worldwide, fully paid up right to use, modify, sell and distribute the p-server,
